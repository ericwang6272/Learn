# Learn

Attended a developer event in Dec 2022 and was inspired by a developer by the name of Lee Gyu Ho from Ava Labs. 
He maintains a 'textbook' on his github to document his learning. 

I am amazed by the humility and work ethic behind that and will like to embark on such an endeavour myself. 
So this repo is a personal whiteboard that I jot down notes from my learnings. 

I appreciate any feedback, do make a pull request or contact me at hickorywang@gmail.com!
